Basics
    - To run streamlit form a command line
        - streamlit run <filename>
    - This should run a new browser tab on port http://localhost:8501/
    - On saving a changed file streamlit gives the opportunity to always rerun the file
        - This should be taken as most files will need to be rerun to display changes 
    - Streamlit generates html which can be inspected in the browser tools
        - It also styles some text such as warnings or errors etc similar to the CSS bootstrap framework does
    - Pandas dataframes can be bought into a file and displayed in a variety of ways
        - The pandas framework does still need to be imported though
